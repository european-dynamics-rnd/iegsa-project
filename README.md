# IEGSA

#### Info
Recognising that the European energy transition requires improved integration of all possible flexibility resources, the INTERRFACE consortium – made up of 42 industrial and academic partners from 16 countries – developed a platform which encourages numerous actors to collaborate and achieve coordinated access to resources and can offer a regulatory framework to improve system efficiencies. Following intensive research and testing, the IEGSA platform was deployed in 9 European countries: Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Italy, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Greece.
